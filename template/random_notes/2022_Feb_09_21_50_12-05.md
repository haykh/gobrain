# Fewer seams
I can usually predict maintenance pain by counting seams. Every seam is a place where two components meet, where assumptions can drift, and where people will ask "which side owns this?" over and over. Some seams are necessary, but many are accidental.

A helpful exercise is to draw the boundaries and then ask: which boundaries actually protect me from change, and which ones just add ceremony. If a boundary doesn't make changes cheaper or safer, it is probably not earning its keep.
