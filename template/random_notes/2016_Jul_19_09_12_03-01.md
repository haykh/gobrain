# Small invariants
I've noticed that reliability usually comes from a handful of small invariants that never change. Not big frameworks, not a new toolchain, but boring things like: "parse input once", "normalize early", "fail loudly", and "make the default path the safe path". When those invariants are written down and enforced, everything else gets easier to reason about.

I want to keep a short list of invariants per project and treat them like a contract. If something breaks the contract, it should feel uncomfortable immediately, like stepping on a Lego. That discomfort is a feature.
