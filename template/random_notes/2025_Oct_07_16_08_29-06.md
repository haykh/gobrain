# Less but sharper
Cutting scope isn't reduction, it's sharpening. The goal is fewer edges, not fewer ideas. Every extra feature adds surface area: more states, more tests, more docs, more chances for something to be half-supported. When I remove a feature, I often discover what the project is actually about.

A good question to ask is: "If I had to explain this in one sentence, what would I keep?" The answer is usually the core. Everything else should justify itself by making the core clearer, faster, safer, or more enjoyable to use.
