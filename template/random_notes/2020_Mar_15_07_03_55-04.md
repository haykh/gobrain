# Latency vs clarity
Fast answers feel good, but clear answers compound. I keep learning that a rushed explanation often creates follow-up work: confusion, rework, or subtle misalignment that shows up later. A slower, clearer answer can be "cheaper" over time.

When I'm writing docs or responding to a question, I want to bias toward clarity. That means defining terms, stating assumptions, and being explicit about what is unknown. It also means using examples that are small enough to run in your head. If someone can simulate it mentally, they can debug it later.
