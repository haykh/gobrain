# Naming things
Most of the "hard problems" I run into are actually naming problems. If I can't name a thing, I can't talk about it precisely, I can't test it cleanly, and I can't see what belongs where. Bad names also invite bad abstractions because they hide the real shape of the problem.

When I'm stuck, a useful move is to rename. Not just variables, but the concept itself: what is this object, what does it promise, what does it refuse to do, and where does the boundary live. Once the name is right, the API usually writes itself.
