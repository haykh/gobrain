# Tests as guardrails
A good test suite is less like a checklist and more like a set of guardrails that keep me from drifting. The best tests capture the intent of the system, not just its current behavior. They tell me what must remain true even after refactors, optimizations, and "quick fixes".

I should be suspicious of tests that only assert incidental details, because they create noise. If a test fails and I immediately want to delete it, that is a signal: either the test is wrong, or it is revealing a rule I didn't know I cared about. Both outcomes are valuable.
