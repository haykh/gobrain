# Dec 29 2025

End-of-year energy is weird: half momentum, half fog. I did a small cleanup pass and it felt surprisingly good, like clearing a desk before starting a new chapter.

I also noticed a pattern: when I'm tired, I reach for complexity because it feels powerful. When I'm rested, I reach for simpler moves. That seems like a useful diagnostic.

Plan: start the next chunk of work by writing the smallest possible version, then grow it only when reality demands it.
