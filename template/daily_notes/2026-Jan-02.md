# Jan 2 2026

I tried an experiment: no multitasking for the first hour. Just one problem, one editor, one line of thought. It felt almost uncomfortable at first, like my brain wanted to check for new inputs. Then it got quiet, and the work started moving.

The work itself wasn't heroic. It was just steady: tighten a function contract, add a test that proves it, and remove the special case that didn't belong. The outcome is small, but it is the kind of small that stays.

Reminder: consistency beats intensity. Do the simple thing again tomorrow.
