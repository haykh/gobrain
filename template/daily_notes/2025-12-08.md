# Dec 8 2025

Woke up feeling like my brain was running a background compile. I tried to write down the top three things that actually mattered today, and it immediately exposed how many "urgent" items are just loud, not important.

Small win: I trimmed a messy section of code and the tests got simpler, not harder. That is usually the best sign that I'm moving in the right direction.

Tomorrow: pick one sharp objective and protect it from meetings, tabs, and "quick" detours.
