# Dec 22 2025

I spent more time than I wanted chasing a flaky behavior that only shows up under the exact wrong timing. It was annoying, but also kind of clarifying: the system is telling me where the real boundary is.

The fix was less "add more code" and more "make the state explicit". Once I did that, the rest became a boring refactor, which is the best outcome.

I want to remember this: if a bug feels spooky, it is usually because something is implicit that should be written down (in code, tests, or both).
