# Dec 15 2025

Today was one of those days where everything works, but nothing feels finished. I kept bouncing between tasks because each one needed some tiny missing detail from another.

I wrote a short checklist for my future self: what must be true before I call something "done". It is boring stuff (docs updated, error paths tested, logs readable) but it prevents that familiar slow leak where problems return a week later wearing a different hat.

Note to self: if I can't explain the change in two sentences, I probably don't understand it yet.
